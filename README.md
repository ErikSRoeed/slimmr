## _slimmr_: SLiM Models in R

### _slimmr_ is now _parsli_
Thanks for your interest in _slimmr_! Please note that _slimmr_ has been
archived. Its development continues under a new name, _parsli_ 
(https://github.com/ErikSRoeed/parsli). This is to avoid any confusion with the
similar R package _slimr_ (which, by the way, you can find here: 
https://github.com/rdinnager/slimr).

### Installation
If you need to install _slimmr_, you can do so from this GitHub archive using
the _devtools_ package from CRAN:
```r
devtools::install_github("ErikSRoeed/slimmr")
```
_slimmr_ naturally requires a working installation of SLiM, which you can 
download from its creators at https://messerlab.org/slim/. Please note that
_slimmr_  and its contributor(s) are neither affiliated with nor endorsed by the
developers of SLiM.

### Publications
The following publication used _slimmr_ v. 0.2.0. Please note that later
releases of _slimmr_ are incompatible, so you should install that version if
you wish to run the code from the paper:

Røed, E. S. & Engelstädter, J. Cytoplasmic incompatibility in hybrid zones: infection dynamics and resistance evolution. J. Evol. Biol. 35, 240–253 (2022).
